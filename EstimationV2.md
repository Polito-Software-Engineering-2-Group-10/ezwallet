Version: 1.1

# Estimation approach
Consider the EZWallet  project in FUTURE version (as proposed by the team), assume that you are going to develop the project INDEPENDENT of the deadlines of the course
# Estimate by size
### 
|             | Estimate                        |             
| ----------- | ------------------------------- |  
| NC =  Estimated number of classes to be developed   |  4 classes                  |             
|  A = Estimated average size per class, in LOC       |   450 LOC per classes                     | 
| S = Estimated size of project, in LOC (= NC * A) | 1800 LOC |  
| E = Estimated effort, in person hours (here use productivity 10 LOC per person hour)  |                    180 person hours                   |  
| C = Estimated cost, in euro (here use 1 person hour cost = 30 euro) | 5400 euro | 
| Estimated calendar time, in calendar weeks (Assume team of 4 people, 8 hours per day, 5 days per week ) |       6 days          |

# Summary

Report here the results of the three estimation approaches. The  estimates may differ. Discuss here the possible reasons for the difference

|             | Estimated effort                        |   Estimated duration |          
| ----------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------|
| estimate by size | 180 person hours | 6 days |
| estimate by product decomposition | 171 person hours | 5 days |
